# traycer
__a python ray tracer__

![traycer](traycer.ppm)

This is a very basic ray tracer developed in python, following the tutorial to building a ray tracer in C++ by Peter Shirley [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I'm not developing this because I think it is useful. Just a project for fun/learning. See [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/bpops/traycer/blob/main/demo.ipynb) for examples of use.
