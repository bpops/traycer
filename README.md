__a python ray tracer__

This is a very basic ray tracer developed in python, following the tutorial to building a ray tracer in C++ by Peter Shirley [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I'm not developing this because I think it is useful. Just a project for fun/learning.
